# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Kickout!!!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A fully working Punchout remake with original sprites and kicks as a new mechanic.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working original port of Punchout with original sprites and possibly animations through Xbox controller input.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A working original port of Punchout with original sprites, animations, and working kicks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A working original port of Punchout with original sprites, animations, working kicks and stance switches, as well a modified health system in which body shots affect stamina more and head shots impact overall health more. If all goes right, I plan to have multiple enemy characters with unique move sets.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I plan to make a port of the original Mike Tyson's punch out game with original player and enemy sprites, as well as the ability to throw punches AND kicks. I plan to do this by using pygame's controller compatibility with an Xbox One controller, mapping punches to the x and y buttons, and kicks to the a and b buttons. I've found multiple tutorials on how to make a punch out port for c#, and plan to use it as the foundation of understanding what I will need to do using pygame. I've also researched various sprite editing softwares, such as piskel and Lopsec, and downloaded the original game assets to be edited to my liking and will be working with a friend who does animation to make the move animations. Aside from that, I have already made a working snake game to practice using pygame, and have been watching videos on mapping controller input.
